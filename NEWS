Overview of Changes in audiowmark-0.6.1:

* improve speed detection/correction
  - performance optimizations to make --detect-speed faster
  - improve accuracy of speed detection
  - make it work properly with short payload
  - add second, slower / more accurate algorithm (--detect-speed-patient)
* fix segfaults during hls-prepare (#11)
* read all input if a process provides audio on stdin to avoid SIGPIPE (#19)
* improve infrastructure for testing audiowmark
  - run some scripts for 'make check' to ensure everything works correctly
  - add CI which builds/tests audiowmark automatically using github actions
  - support various sanitizer builds / STL C++ debug builds
  - fix some issues triggered by sanitizers
* add --strict option: provide strict and more permissive mode
  - "input frames != output frames" is only an error if --strict is used
  - enforce payload size if --strict is used
* improve command line parsing error messages
* documentation updates
* minor fixes
